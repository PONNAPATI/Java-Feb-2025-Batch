Key Points on Method Overloading

1.Overview

        The class uses method overloading by declaring multiple methods named bookTicket, each accepting different parameters.
        This design allows users to book a ticket in various ways, from a basic single-ticket scenario to more advanced bookings with seat types and discount codes.

2.Compile-Time Binding

        Overloading is determined at compile time. The compiler matches method calls to the appropriate version by comparing the number and types of arguments.

3.Distinct Parameter Lists

        Each methodâ€™s signature varies in how many arguments are expected (e.g., just a movie name, or a movie name plus ticket count, seat type, and discount code).
        These unique signatures prevent ambiguity and enable a consistent, single method name (bookTicket).

4.Default vs. Specific Behavior

        Simpler overloads assume defaults like one ticket and a standard seat.
        More detailed overloads accept parameters such as seat type or a discount code to fulfill specific booking requirements.

5.Design & Maintenance

        Method overloading helps maintain a clean, discoverable API:
            You only need one conceptual method name, bookTicket.
            Adding new features (e.g., seat rows, loyalty points) can be done by creating another overload without disrupting existing code.

6.Relation to Other OOP Features

        Overloading (compile-time) differs from overriding (runtime).
        Both belong to polymorphism, but at different binding stages.

7.Conclusion

By providing multiple ways to call the same method, MovieTicketBooking offers flexibility and clarity, illustrating how method overloading can elegantly handle a range of booking scenarios while remaining straightforward to use.
